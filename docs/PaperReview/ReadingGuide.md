### Three Pass Approach

- first pass gives a general idea about the paper
- second pass gives a grasp of the paper's content
- third pass to understand the paper in depth

### First Pass

- usually takes 5-10 minutes

1. Read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
3. Read the conclusions
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read

**Ask yourself about**

1. Category: what type of paper is this?
2. Context: which other papers is it related to?
3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. Clarity: Is the paper well written?
5. Contributions: What are the paper's main contributions?

**If the highlights of the paper cannot be understood in 5-10 minutes, the paper will likely be never read**

### Second Pass

- Read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs

1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper
2. mark relevant unread references for further reading

- Should take up to an hour, and after this read, one must be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper with supporting evidence

### Third Pass

- **Virtually reimplement the paper, meaning making the same assumptions as the authors, recreate thwe work**
- jot down ideas for future work
- can take about four or five hours for beginners, and about an hour for an experienced reader
- one must be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points

### Literature Survey

- use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer to find recent papers
- Do one pass on each paper to decide whether it is worth reading
- find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography to find related papers
- Download the key papers and set them aside

### Other tips

- Read Critically
  - don't assume that the authors are always correct
  - are the assumptions the authors make reasonable
- Write a succint summary in your own words
  - What is the research investigating?
  - Why did the research investigate this?
  - What was found?
  - Are the findings unusual or do they support other research in the field?
  - What are the implications of the results?
  - What experiments could be carried out to answer any further questions?
- If possible, compare the paper to other works
  - Are the ideas novel? Or have they appeared before?
  - Some paper offer new ideas, others implement ideas, and show how they work, others bring previous ideas together and unite them under a novel framework
